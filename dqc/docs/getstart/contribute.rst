Reporting and fixing bugs
-------------------------

If you find a bug, please report it to the :github:`Github page <issues>` with

You can fix the bug you reported or the bugs reported by others.

Writing a new feature / simulation
----------------------------------

If you want to implement a new feature or simulation, please raise an issue on
the :github:`Github page <issues>` before starting your work.
It will be reviewed if the feature is suitable for DQC.
If approved, you are welcome to make a pull request.
We can also give pointers on how to implement the feature if you don't
