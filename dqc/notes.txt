Reasons for non-convergence of self-consistent iteration:
* inadequate basis
    sol: trying more complete basis might help
* presence of (near-)degenerate states
    sol: this is hard problem, but might be solved in some cases by setting the
         spin number in a molecule so that the degenerate states are evenly
         occupied
* inadequacy of algorithm
    sol: tune the scf parameters or change the algorithm
